Demonstration of a revolutionary language that allows for any arbitrary program to be written without taking up any memory

The demonstration shows an implementation of Quicksort which takes up no memory

File Numbering Scheme
==================

This is a common problem with long programs (over 10 lines) where the ordering of lines can cause errors due to the numbering of files. This is the correct procedure for numbering files:

1. Estimate the maximum number of lines in your code, call it x
2. Now find log base 10 of x, call that y
3. Now round down y, call that z
4. Now find 10 to the power of z
5. Start counting the lines of code from the number z

Example - if you guess your code will have 60 lines, start counting at 10.
